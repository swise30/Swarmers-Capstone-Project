# Swarmers-Capstone-Project
The goal of this project is to develop a small form factor autonomous float for investigating methane seeps in Mono Lake and the Gulf of Mexico. The vehicle must be able to dive and ascend on its own using a buoyancy engine. It will use ocean currents to traverse laterally. The final form of the vehicle will have swarm capabilities that will allow it to communicate with other MicroFloats to act as nodes in a large mesh to map a vast area of water. The investigation of biologically produced methane in terrestrial saline and aquatic environments is a relevant analog to the study of environments in worlds like Titan, Enceladus, and Europa, where methane emissions indicate the potential for life.
